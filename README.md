Calculates snowballing debts to payoff


Up to 10 debts can be snowballed together. Enter the dollar amount of each debt, the decimal value of the interest rate and the monthly payment made to the account. You also have the option to increase the amount paid each year by a fixed amount. 

Started because I needed to learn how to generate GUIs for a work assignment but also wanted a calculator to figure out how much time it would take if I snowballed all of my debts.
